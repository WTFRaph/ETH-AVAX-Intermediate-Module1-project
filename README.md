#MyContract Smart Contract
#Overview
MyContract is a Solidity smart contract designed to manage and manipulate an integer value on the blockchain. It includes functions to set, reset, increase, and decrease this value, with access restricted to the contract owner for these operations.

#Description
This Solidity smart contract demonstrates basic functionality using require() for input validation and assert() for internal consistency checks. The contract allows the owner to manage a stored integer value securely, ensuring only authorized access for value modification operations.

#Getting Started
Prerequisites
To interact with this contract, you will need:

Access to a blockchain development environment or simulator (e.g., Remix IDE, Truffle framework)
Basic knowledge of Solidity and smart contract deployment
Executing the Program
Deploy the Contract

Deploy the MyContract smart contract on a blockchain network using a development environment or simulator.

Interact with the Contract

Once deployed, interact with the contract through its functions:

setValue(uint256 newValue): Set the stored value to newValue.
resetValue(): Reset the stored value to zero.
increaseValue(uint256 newValue): Increase the stored value by newValue.
decreaseValue(uint256 decrementValue): Decrease the stored value by decrementValue.
Ensure operations are performed by the contract owner to avoid permission errors.
